<p>LANGLEY, VA&mdash;A report released Tuesday by the CIA's Office of the Inspector General revealed that the CIA 
    has mistakenly obscured hundreds of thousands of pages of critical intelligence information with black 
    highlighters.
</p> 
<p>According to the report, sections of the documents&mdash;"almost invariably the most crucial passages"&mdash;are 
    marred by an indelible black ink that renders the lines impossible to read, due to a top-secret highlighting 
    policy that began at the agency's inception in 1947.
</p> 
<p>CIA Director <strong>Porter Goss</strong> lamented the fact that the public will probably never know the particulars of 
    several historic events, such as:
    <ul> 
        <li>the Cold War</li> 
        <li>the civil-rights movement</li> 
        <li>the growth of the international drug trade</li>
    </ul>
