    <p>About me: Starting out after high school going into various different careers, Samuel often thought of <br>
        reaching for more. He enrolled in college with the hopes of obtaining a degree in computer <br>
        science, but alas, he felt quite bored, and unable to truly find the spark or passion in the field. <br>
        Now, he is enrolled in software development, ready to begin mastering computers instead of <br>
        being mastered by them.
