        <h3 class="ans2">Isn't it true that henchpeople that apply through your service have a 100% chance of being arrested,<br>
                                             mostly due to being tracked through this website?</h3>
        <p id='second' style='display: none;'>What? <br> 
                                              No, total coincidence.<br>

                                             programs at your local police department. (No, you will not be arrested, we have determined that doing illegal activities in front of police <br>
                                             officers is the last thing that they would expect.)</p>
